# Disclaimer

Thank you very much for the feedback and contributions. It makes me really happy to see that the script generates enough interest for people like you to take the time to suggest solutions.

## About This Project

Just to make things clear, as I’ve already mentioned, **I am neither a Linux user nor a programmer**.  
This script is my **first attempt at learning Python** and my **only project** (apart from a few basic scripts for personal use). When I started, I was **starting from scratch** and learning as I went. This script is therefore a **collection of all the beginner’s mistakes**, which I try to fix over time (thanks to your input, among others).

Additionally, when I first started working on the script, my only goal was **to help myself update my mods**—I never planned on sharing it. That’s why the comments are in French.  
Whenever I remember, I try to change them little by little, but it's still sporadic. **New updates are now in English** (unless I forget out of habit).

## Code Quality & Structure

As you can imagine, **the script is a bit messy**.  
I mean, the structure and the code were written **as they came to me**. I’m well aware of that.  

I don’t want to modify the core of the code **more than necessary**, because I would likely break everything and spend way too much time on it.  
That’s why I decided to **take my time** and start a **new, cleaner version**, while taking into account the knowledge I’ve gained and all of your feedback.

## Learning Process & Contributions

Above all, this remains **a learning project**. Many things I read in your comments are **"incomprehensible"** due to my lack of knowledge.  
I have to adapt, and that helps me move forward, but I admit that I take my time, and that might be **frustrating** for you.

On top of that, I’m **not comfortable with GitHub**, so don’t be surprised if I don’t always merge things as expected.  
I’ve run into issues a few times after merging code—not because the code itself was problematic, but either because:

- I **didn’t understand** what it did, or  
- My code **could no longer handle** certain values.

## Unexpected Popularity

I was really surprised to see that **my script has been used so extensively**, far more than I had imagined.  
That makes me very happy, but at the same time, **it’s a bit stressful** to feel like I don’t have the skills to make it more accessible to everyone.

## Final Words

Regardless, **thank you again** for your support and contributions!
