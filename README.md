<br><br>

This a third-party program. It means it is NOT a mod. You do not have to put it in the mods folder.<br>
All you have do to is :
- extract the archive
- run the program
- wait while checking/updating
- play once finished
<p>This program checks the "mods" folder and updates the mods if necessary. Once finished, if there has been an update, it creates an updates_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt file in the "logs" folder.</p>
<p>Before quitting the program, you can choose to generate a pdf file listing ALL your mods in the 'Mods' folder.</p>
