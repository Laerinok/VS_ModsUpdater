This a third-party program. It means it is NOT a mod. You do not have to put it in the mods folder.
All you have do to is :
extract the archive
run the program
wait while checking/updating
play once finished
This program checks the "mods" folder and updates the mods if necessary. Once finished, if there has been an update, it creates an updates_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt file in the "logs" folder.

Before quitting the program, you can choose to generate a pdf file listing ALL your mods in the 'Mods' folder.
